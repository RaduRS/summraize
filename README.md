Task:
I want you to analyze my entire codebase, including the pricing page and other key sections, to understand what my app offers. Based on this, design and develop a breathtaking, high-converting landing page that:

Captivates Visitors Immediately

Use a hero section with an engaging headline and CTA.
Implement smooth transitions, animations, and interactive elements (e.g., hover effects, reveal animations).

Ensures High-Performance & SEO Excellence

Optimize for Google Lighthouse scores (speed, accessibility, SEO).
Use Next.js 15 best practices for server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG).
Implement semantic HTML, meta tags, Open Graph tags, and structured data for improved search rankings.
Drives Conversions with Effective CTAs

Strategically place call-to-action (CTA) buttons throughout the page.
Use A/B testing-friendly layouts for optimal click-through rates.
Include a pricing summary or plan preview with a CTA to the full pricing page.
Reflects My Appâ€™s Core Purpose & Offering

Pull key information from pricing, features, and other app pages.
Clearly communicate the value proposition (speech-to-text, document summarization, AI voice synthesis, pay-as-you-go model).
Use engaging visuals and icons that align with the app's brand.
