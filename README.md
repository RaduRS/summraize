I wanted to integrate Hotjar and posthog and vercel Speed Insights in my platform. This is an MVP app for now. Please see layout, page, and pricing to get a better understanding of my app or even consult the whole @codebase.
I already installed npm i @vercel/speed-insights and also google analytics is configured and I can see the stats in my google analytics dashboard

How, when and for what to use each platform to get the most out of it?
